I am in my own bed tonight for the first time in twelve days after having been on the scariest personal journey of my life. And here I am on the other side, alive and kicking and in one piece. I've been through a window I hardly knew even existed where if one is driven fast enough from one facility to another while giving one's consent to do whatever it takes after being told that many people do not survive such a procedure, there is a small chance the cowboy hero at the other side waiting for your arrival will pull it off and save your life. In my case, he did save my life (along with the 12 wild days and nights of followup care in the ICU). I am thankful but tired - but I am alive. It's great to be back. More soon for those who care to watch for updates after I've had more time to rest, recover, and reflect.
