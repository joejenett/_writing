so magnificent  
those rare beings that shape us  
and then go away

i stop to wonder  
what is this thing we call life  
and why so fragile?

maybe the truth is  
we are not meant to see through  
spiritual things

nothing so sad as  
presence becoming absence  
in just a moment

maybe the truth is  
we were never designed to  
really understand
