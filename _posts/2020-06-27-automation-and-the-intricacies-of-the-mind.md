It’s a routine task. My feed reader doesn’t show the Pinboard user’s name as a link. In fact, it’s not even text. If I want to see that user’s pinboard page I’ve got to type it out. With the help of a simple Keyboard Maestro shortcut, I can type the user’s name to open their pinboard page. Bang!

But that’s not the magic. The act of reading the (sometimes odd) name and remembering it long enough to type it is the real challenge. Every time I pull it off, I experience a mild sense of amazement of how the mind works. Every trick is another automation.
