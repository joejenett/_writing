A few days ago, Kim and I were having that first cup of coffee enjoying some typical bantering that 4:30am brings. We’re a little strange like that.

I don’t remember exactly what we were talking about but I said, “Hey Siri, tell Kim to go back to China.” It’s an inside joke I won’t bore you with. We understand it.

Anyway, Siri asked me to confirm and I did without really listening to what she said. My bad. She sent a message to a guy named Ken I know whose last name sounds a little like “back to.” It read, “Vagina.”

The rest is history. Thanks Siri!
