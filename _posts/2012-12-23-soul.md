When you can’t remember where you come from  
And you can’t recover from the pain  
Take a look around you, let your life astound you  
When your soul has found you, you’ll be fine again

So easy to forget all the spirit  
That you felt before the tables turned on you  
But a fire burns deep inside a broken heart that tries to hide  
And when the pain subsides, you’ll know just what to do

Hold on to your soul, it’s everything you know  
Be true to your soul to find the answer  
It’s all in your soul, the thing that makes you whole  
And carries you home, it’s alright…
