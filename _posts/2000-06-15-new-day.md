<small>(Circa 2000)</small>
 
thought your time was planned for you  
you never stopped, you'd never do  
the crazy thing, you'd never sing  
a song about yourself  
  
mountain roads and rainbows wide  
take a trip and step inside  
the one you know, it's time to go  
be strong about yourself  
  
i've spent so many years  
thinkin' i was wrong  
i've cried too many tears  
singin' lonely blues songs  
  
you're the one to help yourself  
as others fade away  
into night, you're gaining sight  
living out your new day
